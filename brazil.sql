The next world cup takes place in Brazil. 48 group matches, then 8 matches, then quarters, semis, final &amp; third place match. I still think this point system, based on odds for the match, is better than the previous one. The question is: which coefficients to give the second round matches? If the first 48 matches have a coefficient of 1. What about 2 for the round of 16, 3 for the quarter finals, 5 for the semis, 8 for the final and 2 for the 3rd place match? That way, the sum of the coefficients for the second round is 48, too. I don\'t want to give too much for the second round as I don\'t want to make the first 48 matches unimportant. Every match counts!<br/>As for other options - extra time, penalty kicks... I can implement them but it will mean fantastic odds if someone bets on \'Italy winning after extra-time, no penalty kicks\' and wins. Any suggestions welcome of course!','2014-06-15 07:54:40',18),(1350,1349,7,'etienne','Etienne','','0000-00-00','00:00:00','Not an easy task ! Finding a \'\'fair\'\' system. I think you have done a wonderful job so far.<br/><br/>In this Euro, Milie is ahead, and that\'s what would have happened in any professional betting website (bwin, betclic, etc) : she found some good results (like many of us) + she predicted Denmark (against Holland) and Greece (against Russia). It would be unfair if she only had bet on the underdogs (which could be a strategy) but that\'s not the case. Had she bet only on the underdogs, she would have received good points with Denmark and Greece, but she would not be leading. It\'s like betting all the time against Nadal, Djokovic and Federer : it will bring me a nice amount of cash one day, but in the meantime I will lose a lot of money, and not sure that what I win later will compensate all my losses...<br/><br/>So, it\'s really difficult to prepare a fair system for the World Cup because you want to keep the suspense going in the ranking, even after the group games. And it\'s true that, with this \'\'odds\'\' system, it will be very tempting to bet for North Korea against Brazil : at worse you lose 1.3 points against the rest, and maybe you can get 18 points... BUT then everybody will do the same and Brazil will be the underdogs on our website ! :)<br/><br/>All in all, your suggestion here above sounds pretty good to me... but I did not think about it for 2 hours, I am sure other people have suggestions.

I had stats like \'remaining tokens\', \'tokens per correct pick\', \'tokens lost per incorrect pick\', and who is winning is someone who does well on the last two. The remaining tokens give an idea of the potential change, which of course can mean anything.<br/>So whether you win or you lose, you are not sure of what happens during the whole tournament. <br/>I like the odds system because what you get is associated with the risk you take.

La France gagnera la finale 3 à 0.\n\n- L’approche pragmatique : vous êtes pour la France ? Misez pour l’Italie : si la France gagne, ben c’est la fête.

It is rare that creativity and flair wins you a final, it is more about keeping it together (whatever that means).<br/><br/>Spain will lose to Argentina in the semis. Sonner or later, history will catch up with the Spaniards who in spite of winning Euro knows that they don\'t have what it takes to go all the way in WC. The curse will live on! Thing with Spain is that they can\'t handle pressure, being a goal down to an equal team. They will have an easy time through the group and be lucky to meet Ivory Coast and Cameroon in the 1/8 &amp; ¼ finals so when there is finally a great team on the other side, Spain won\'t be prepared and Argentina will want it more, even though Torres &amp; Villa will score the roof on fire on their way there.<br/><br/>WC 2010 won\'t have a lot of surprises. All the favorites will win their groups except Italy who will be second to Slovakia (since Slovak beats Paraguay and Italy only draw). This doesn\'t matter since both of them will exit in the 1/8 final, Italy (who will be overall disappointing in good defending champion tradition) to a ferocious Holland (who as always will win their group games by 4-0, 5-0, 4-1 – look out for van Persie for the Golden Boot!) and Slovakia to Cameroon, who will ”surprise” most people by reaching the quarters, but how surprising is it really? They play in a shit group with Japan and Denmark which have looked like zombies in the last games. So, being on that high, of course Cam can go on to beat Slovakia and then lose big to Spain in the quarters.<br/><br/>Ivory Coast have the advantage of playing North Korea last and can keep pushing forward even if they lead 3-0, and since goal difference is on top of head-to-head meetings this time, and the fact that Svennis will go for a draw in the other games (and being successful as he usually is outside of Mexico), Ivory Coast will reach the 1/8ths where they lose to Spain. Adeus Portugal!<br/><br/>The other Swedish African - Lagerbäck (oh, how we wish the Nigerians will adopt him and give him a nice hut on the savannah, VERY close to the lion den...) - will also reach the 1/8ths with Nigeria. All they need to do really is to explode against South Corea in the last game which is much more likely than the opposite. In the 1/8ths will they lose on penalties to Handce.... I mean France, who will play like shit but still reach the quarters and win their group, probably after scoring only one goal (1-0, 0-0, 0-0).<br/><br/>Handce.... I mean France, will get lucky tonight against Uruguay – 1-0 in a totally boring game. One can only guess how the goal will happen... throw-in? Handsy... I mean Henry will accidentally steer a freekick with his ass? A passing pelican will score with a header (or perhaps a ”beaker”)? 4th official – Swedish Martin Handson (surprise, surprise... he was NOT assigned any games as 1st official this WC, only as 4th...) - will add an extra 348 minutes injury time and all player will pass out except Gallas who will score by drooling on the ball. (sorry, my amis, no cheering for France this time around – the reason to why I have been drinking Guiness instead of red wine the past 8 months is NOT because it tastes better)<br/>','2010-06-11 12:09:03',2),(455,454,8,'ranis','Ranis','','0000-00-00','00:00:00','Part 2 - <br/><br/>In the premier South Africa will start very intense but since Mexico has more talent and none of the teams can afford to loose, it will be a draw. Expect all-out attack from whatever team is down, could be a fun game if there is an early goal. Uruguay will then beat South Africa in a very exciting and offensive game by 3-2, where Suarez will have some sort of international breakthrough, and reach the 1/8ths where they lose to Argentina.<br/><br/>Handce... I mean France, will lose the quarters to my only surprise package... Serbia, which will then run out of steam and lose the semis to Brazil. Don\'t be fooled by the start of the serbs, they will  look nervous and confused and terrified to be ridiculed as last time so they will draw in all their group games but still advance and suddenly realize that WC actually is now some sort of success for them, where upon they can finally relax, pressure is off, and just let the talent they have just roll out. Being on this high, they will comfortably beat England (which as always is ridiculously overhyped) in the 1/8ths and Handce.... I mean France in the quarters.<br/><br/>England will comfortably win their group but draw in the final match against the underestimated Slovenia, which will go 2nd in the group. Slovenia will then lose in a sleepy game to Germany in the 1/8th but Argentina will revenge Germany in the quarters.<br/><br/>Chile will be second in Group H and then lose to Brazil, who will have an surprisingly easy time breaking down the Netherlands offense in the quarters (as seen before).<br/><br/>If anyone is still reading this, don\'t you have better things to do??!! Anyway, I am mostly writing this to upgrade my reputation to being a genius, a football-Nostradamus, in case it all comes true... then this is for the record (NO, I have not done this before, if you think I have then... well then, boo you!).  If it doesn\'t come true my reputation will simply remain as being ”that weird guy over there” so I ain\'t got much to loose.<br/><br/>Other predictions are -<br/>1. the sales of vuvuzelas will sharply decrease during the tournament and, in the end, the semis and final will be broadcasted either without background sound... I mean noise, or with the sound from the last WC (so don\'t be surprised to hear the chant ”campione del mondo” in a quarter between Brazil and Netherlands)<br/><br/>2. In a survey in 2014 on the question - ”Which teams out of Switzerland, Australia, Denmark and Paraguay did participate in the WC 2010?”, 102% will choose option - ”None”.<br/><br/>3. All North Corean players will be hunted by the Dutch division one coaches as soon as they realize that they arn\'t aware of the concept of getting paid.<br/><br/>4. Maradona will break the world record in tellings from the 4th official to ”not cross the line”, ”don\'t spit at the opponents” and ”No, Mr. Maradona, please understand, coaches are NOT allowed to take any free-kicks just for fun, or dribble around the field in the interval”<br/><br/>5. Apartheid will finally be frowned upon and rejected by the Western world (you know, it is actually not a very nice system), sanctions will come into place and the good word of freedom will spread among South Africans and free elections will be held in 2012, or maybe 2013.<br/><br/>As oppose to what many thinks, the weather won\'t matter at all and I am sure that everyone understands that just because a lot of people speak English in South Africa will NOT mean that England will feel ”at home” in a country where they dance barefeet on funerals.','2010-06-11 11:40:16',0),(456,453,7,'etienne','Don Draper','','0000-00-00','00:00:00','Ranis !

It will be a static and passive game where your position on the pitch will be more important than becoming a hero (similar to Germany\'s brilliant tactic in the semi). Rather 100 times careful than 1 time careless. 0-0 and penalties?<br/><br/>Some people have been writing here that there is no such thing as ”deserving” to win a game or the WC title, but this is nonsense. Regardless of whatever team you cheer for, everyone wants the winner to be the best team, a team that we can show at least some sort of admiration for, a team that we will remember after many years as a great team. So far, the previous WC winners has been that team, Italy did it with the slightest of margins last time, but looking back, they were worth winning as all the other previous champions in recent memory.<br/><br/>But this time, Spain (the new Italy) is a total joke, they score 6 goals in 6 games, one fluke after another with tons of crappy ref calls on the way. Tici-taca... what\'s so goddamn entertaining to watch a team pass the ball around sidaways for 90 minutes? Imagine if Spain wins the final by 1-0 and afterwards we watch a chronicle of Spain\'s ”amazing” path to the title, it is gonna be outright embarrassing. <br/><br/>Holland hasn\'t really been too good either and had a few lucky breaks to say the least (1-1 to Brazil, offside goal 2-1 to Uruguay), but at least they have the chance of becoming winners by pride by making a super final and crushing Spain. Though this seems unlikely and whoever wins will not be remembered as a great WC winner. <br/><br/>All in all, this has been my lowsiest World Cup experience so far, and I don\'t like that we have a ”new” country to win it. What\'s new with Holland and/or Spain? It what way does that feel fresh? booooooooring... Ghana, Chile or Japan would have been new and fun, even Uruguay would have been newer.<br/><br/>It\'s been a disappointment. It started already with the vuvuzelas that messed up the sound and atmosphere (I only remember hearing one single chant in some USA game). Handce made complete fools of themselves but they shouldn\'t even have been there from the start, but most of all the ref/FIFA sitaution has been shameful and turned much of this into a lottery leading teams into organizing their diving skills.<br/><br/>Of course my favorite teams (Germany, Italy &amp; Argentina) has let me down and teams I hate (Spain, Holland) has progressed. But I also hate Brazil and in the past Argentina &amp; Germany and it has always felt ok anyway when one of them has won since it was obvious they were the best teams. <br/><br/>Well, this pretty much sums it up. Thanks for listening to my whining. Thanks Nico &amp; Co for organizing the betting and forum, it truly enhances the whole thing.
